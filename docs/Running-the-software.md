If you installed the software using an installer or a package manager system (`rpm`, `deb`), you just need to use the standard running procedures of your Operating System to run the application.

### Windows
In windows, this means clicking on `Start` and then browsing the start menu folder `Gaia Sandbox`. You can run the executable from there.

### Linux
Just type `gaiasandbox` in a terminal or use your favourite desktop environment search engine to run the Gaia Sandbox launcher.

### OS X
Locate the launcher using the main search.

### Code and pakcage

However, if you are a maverick and do not like installers, you can also run the Gaia Sandbox directly from the source code in `GitHub` or using the `tgz` package.

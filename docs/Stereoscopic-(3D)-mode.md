The Gaia Sandbox includes a [stereoscopic mode](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereoscopy) or 3D mode which outputs two images each intended for each eye, creating the illusion of depth.



In order to activate the stereoscopic mode press `LEFT_CTRL` + `S`.

### Stereoscopic profiles

Usually, as the images are placed side by side (even though most 3DTVs also support up and down), the right image is intended for the right eye and the left image is intended for the left eye. This works with 3DTVs and VR head sets (such as the [Oculus Rift](https://www.oculus.com/), [Google cardboard](https://www.google.com/get/cardboard/), etc.). In 3DTVs, however, the image is distorted because each half of the TV will be stretched back to the whole TV area when the 3D mode is on.

Additionally, there is a technique called cross-eye 3D (you can find some examples [here](http://digital-photography-school.com/9-crazy-cross-eye-3d-photography-images-and-how-to-make-them/), and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBa-bCxsZDk) is a very nice video teaching the concept and how to achieve it) which works without any extra equipment and consists on trying to focus your eyes some distance before the actual image so that each eye receives the correct image. In this case the right images goes to the left eye and the left image goes to the right eye.

In order to manage all these parameters, we have created 3 stereoscopic profiles which can be selected by the user and are described below.

- **`VR_HEADSET`** - The **left** image goes to the **left** eye. No distortion is applied.
- **`Crosseye`** - The **left** image goes to the **right** eye. No distortion is applied.
- **`3DTV`** - The **left** image goes to the **left** eye. Distortion is applied.

In order to switch between the three modes, use `LEFT_CTRL` + `LEFT_SHIFT` + `S`.

360 mode
********

Gaia Sky includes a 360 mode where the scene is rendered in all directions to a `cube map <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cube_mapping>`__.
This cube map is then projected onto a flat image using an `equirectangular projection <http://alexcpeterson.com/2015/08/25/converting-a-cube-map-to-a-sphericalequirectangular-map/>`__. The final image can be used
to create 360 videos with head tracking (see `here <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bvsb8LZwkgc&t=33s>`__)

.. hint:: To activate the 360 mode, click on the |360| icon in the camera section of the controls window. Exit by clicking |360| again.

.. hint:: ``L-CTRL`` + ``3`` -- Can also be used to toggle the 360 mode.

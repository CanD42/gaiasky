The Gaia Sandbox offers the possibility to run `Python` scripts in the same `JVM` using [`Jython`](http://www.jython.org/).

You can find some example scripts in the [`scripts`](/ari-zah/gaiasandbox/tree/master/android/assets/scripts) folder of the project.

An interface is provided in order to encapsulate some complex-behaviour functions and to make scripting easier. This scripting interface is described in the following section:

- [[The scripting interface]]

### How to run scripts

Each script is executed in its own thread in the virtual machine, and runs alongside the Gaia Sandbox. In order to run a script, follow the procedure described in the [[User interface > running scripts|User-interface#running-scripts]] section.
